## Welcome to Lloyd Business Services LLC's Software Portfolio! 👋

### Our dice roller collection

[Our dice roller repository](../../../../diceRollers) contain implementations of a dice rolling server and client system in different programming languages.

Currently, we've merged in only the [node.js implementation](../../../../diceRollers/README.md#nodejs).  The others will be merged in to the repo in the near future.
